  <description>
         The 'nfsserver' user is allowed to proxy all members of the 'users-group1' and 
         'users-group2' groups. Note that in most cases you will need to include the
         group "root" because the user "root" (which usually belonges to "root" group) will
         generally be the user that initially executes the mount on the NFS client system. 
         Set this to '*' to allow nfsserver user to proxy any group.
