# Design of BK-BASE
The design concept of BK-BASE follows the whole process of the big data life cycle, and at the same time provides low-threshold middle-tier services, adapts to various Iaas layers at the bottom, and connects to SaaS applications in different scenarios at the upper layer. Self-service data access, SQL-based logical configuration, open up heterogeneous multi-scenario applications, and multi-dimensional analysis and other functions, low-cost, high-efficiency construction of intelligent, visual R&D tools and operating systems.
